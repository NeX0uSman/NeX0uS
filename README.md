Hi,
This is my first uploaded project. It was built using JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and helpful libraries such as Swiper, among others.

Features:
Display of product images and phone models

Dynamic UI updates based on user input

Shopping cart functionality:

Add items

View selected items

Remove items from the cart

The project demonstrates my growing skills in frontend development and working with component-based architecture in React.
