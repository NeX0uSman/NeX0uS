Hi,
This is my first uploaded project. It was built using JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and helpful libraries such as Swiper, among others.
The biggest part of the effort was aimed at DESIGN AND OVERALL LOOK
Features:
Display of product images and phone models

Dynamic UI updates based on user input

Shopping cart functionality:

Add items

View selected items

Remove items from the cart

The project demonstrates my growing skills in frontend development and working with component-based architecture in React.
